    "You will make use of a pre-trained neural network (`VGG19`) to implement the **DeepDream (gradient ascent)** algorithm using TensorFlow to generate art with a neural network! The algorithm projects the receptive fields of specific filters and/or layers onto the input image to create some trippy effects! A neat side effect of this process is that you can visualize how learned weights at different levels of the network interact with parts of the input image.\n",

    "1. Load in the VGG19 pre-trained network without the output layer.\n",
    "2. Make a readout model â€” a `Keras Model` object that allows us extract activations (`netActs`) within the subset of VGG19 network layers of our choice. Neurons in these layers of the VGG19 network will \"dream\": modify the input image to amplify patterns that the cells \"want to see\" based on their learned weight patterns. \n",

    "4. Pass image through the readout network model, compute the netAct values and gradient at the selected layers.\n",
