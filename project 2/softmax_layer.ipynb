    "\n",
    "This can take quite a bit of simulation time! Here are some tips:\n",
    "- I suggest using a coarse-to-fine search strategy. Try varying hyperparameters over many orders of magnitude, then follow up with a 2nd search that \"zooms in\" around the hyperparameters that gave you the best results from the first search, as determined by your print outs. You can be informal about this and hard-code the coarse and fine hyperparameter choices. Abort searches prematurely if you feel there aren't productive (no reason to wait!). This can take however long or short that you want to dedicate. Remember, you are printing out the best parameter values on each run, so you can always just proceed with those.\n",
    "- You should be able to achieve ~30% accuracy without too much effort (10% is chance performance).\n",
    "- High learning rates don't really make sense. You'll know if your value is \"high\" if numpy complains about numerical issues.\n",
    "- Your mini-batch sizes should be `<= N` and `>= 1`.\n",
    "- Time single network runs with a few different batch sizes you plan on trying in your big search. This will help you figure out a ballpark estimate how long grid search will take (*you can decide whether to go eat dinner, run it overnight, etc.*). If it will take an unreasonable amount of time, reduce the number of parameters you try in one search.\n",
    "- Think about whether you need *3 nested loops* or *a sequence of single loops*.\n",
    "- Turn off print outs from `fit` (adjust `verbose` argument) and only print out things related to your search.\n",
    "- Feel free to try a search with more than 75 training epochs for potentially better accuracy, but note that the search will take longer to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:** I am not grading based on your performance numbers or the number of hours your computer spends searching. I want to see that you successfully implemented the grid search to find progressively better hyperparameters on STL-10 and use the outcome to inform your ultimate training session that you use to evaluate predictions on the test set. *Getting full credit here does not require you spending hours of searching!*"
